Dear Lucas Snow,
I hope you are doing good! I wanted to make an update describing the new features of the Lucas Snow's Adventure website and explain how it has made with accessibility for everyone in mind especially with people with visual impairments like yourself.
The website includes the following accessibility elements to enhance the experience of people with visual and mental disadvantages:
1.	Screen Reader Compatibility:
•	To help people with visual impairments all the images on the website, including action shots of snowboarding, come with detailed alternative text. For example, an image of a snowboarder performing an aerial trick is described as "Snowboarder performing an aerial trick with snow-covered mountains in the background."
•	The website uses clear headings to help people navigate easier throughout the website, such as navigation links and content areas which are clear and straight to the point headings.

2.	Simple and Clear Navigation:
•	The top bar includes easy-to-access links labeled "Home," "About," and "Contact," helping you understand where you are on the site and move quickly between pages.

3.	Keyboard-Friendly Navigation:
•	You can navigate the website entirely with your keyboard. The links and buttons are structured so that you can move through them using the "Tab" key on the keyboard, it helps people who are unable to move the mouse to navigate to the headings.

4.	Accessible Forms:
•	If a customer would wish to get in touch via the "Contact Us" link, the form on the site is designed with clear labels that work well with people with visual impairments, making it easy for you to provide your information if needed.

5.	High Contrast and Readability:
•	For those with low vision, the website has high contrast between text and background, which also ensures that screen readers can interpret it correctly without interference from complex layouts. This helps people with colour-blindness and dyslexia well less turned away from the website.
The website aims to provide an enjoyable experience for everyone, including people with vision impairments and other impairments. 
I hope this email helps you envision your website with ease! Let us know if you have any questions or need additional information as we are always on standby ready to implement any new features you want.
Best regards,
Stepan,Danas,Ruslan

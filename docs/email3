Dear Lucas Snow, 

I'm reaching out to share a detailed update on the recent improvements and upcoming optimizations for your website, which is now live on GitHub Pages: View your site. 

Website Performance Overview 

We recently ran a performance check using Google Lighthouse. The results show that your website is performing very well on desktop, with a score of 99 out of 100. Key metrics include: 

First Contentful Paint (FCP): 0.7 seconds, meaning the initial content appears quickly. 

 

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 0.8 seconds, which indicates fast load times for the main content. 

 

On mobile devices, the current score is 88 out of 100. This is still strong, but we’re working to make it even better for mobile users. 

Recent Improvements 

Here are some updates we’ve already made: 

Image Optimization: We’ve reduced image file sizes across the site to make pages load faster. Original, uncompressed images are saved in the “img/originals” folder for reference or future use. 

 

File Organization: Non-website files, like the email file, have been moved to a “Docs” folder to keep the main project folder organized and focused on website files. 

 

Meta Description Added: A meta tag has been added to help search engines understand the site’s purpose, which could improve search visibility. 

 

Favicon Added: We added a small icon (favicon) to the browser tab to give the site a more polished look. 

Planned Mobile Optimizations 

To further enhance the mobile experience, here are the next steps we’ll take: 

Reduce Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Delay: Right now, the main content on mobile takes about 4.2 seconds to appear. To improve this, we’ll further compress large images and preload key images to make them load faster. 

 

Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources: Some CSS and JavaScript files are adding about 1.5 seconds to the initial load time. We’ll address this by inlining only essential CSS and delaying non-essential JavaScript until after the main content loads. 

 

Reduce Unused CSS: About 19 kilobytes of unused CSS is currently slowing down the load time. We’ll clean up the CSS by removing unnecessary styles, which will help speed up the pages. 

 

Improve Caching for Static Assets: We’ll adjust caching settings so returning visitors can load images, CSS, and JavaScript from their cache, speeding up load time for repeat visits. 

 

We’re confident that these optimizations will bring the mobile score closer to 99 out of 100, matching the desktop performance. 

Accessibility Enhancements and New Page Addition 

Your website has achieved a perfect Accessibility Score of 100. Here are some improvements we made to enhance readability and accessibility: 

Improved Contrast: Enhanced contrast between text and background colors. 

 

ARIA Labels Added: Added ARIA labels for better compatibility with screen readers. 

We’ve also added a new Trips page to showcase the travel experiences your business offers. This page includes detailed descriptions of each trip, including itineraries, activities, and images, to help visitors find and book the perfect experience. You can view the new page here. 

Next Steps 

With these planned updates, we’re confident that the mobile experience will soon match the high performance as on desktop. These improvements should also positively impact search engine rankings and overall user satisfaction. 

Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss any specific details about these updates. We look forward to continuing to enhance your website and making sure it meets your goals and the needs of your customers. 

Best regards, 

Danas, Stepan, and Ruslan
